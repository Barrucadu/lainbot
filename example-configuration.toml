# Backend configuration lives in the "backend.*" namespace.
#
# Any global configuration can be overridden in a backend by simply
# replicating the appropriate hierarchy, like in the plugin.hello
# example below.
#
# Similarly, the global configuration can provide defaults for any
# value in the backend configuration. When a backend is instantiated,
# the global and backend configurations are merged, with the backend
# configuration taking priority. The backend-specific configuration is
# then drawn from this merged configuration.
